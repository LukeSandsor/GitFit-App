# CSC307 Term Project

### Introduction
A free to use an open source fitness app for Cal Poly's CSC 307 class taught by professor BJ Klingenberg

See more here https://www.gitfit.me/

### Description
As mentioned before, GitFit is a student project for a software engineering class. Though initially a fitness app was just a more interesting alternative to the proposed ideas and templates for project, everyone in the group had a fun time developing their own little branches and ideas that they thought would be important to a fitness app. In the end we think we did a good job and are happy that it turned out as well as it did.
